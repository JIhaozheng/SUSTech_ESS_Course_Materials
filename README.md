# ESS206: Fundamentals of Signal Processing and Data Analysis

## Course Overview

**Instructor:** Prof. Peng Han  
**Main Focus:** Signal Processing

Although the course title mentions both *signal processing* and *data analysis*, it mainly focuses on signal processing. In my opinion, **data analysis is more important** for us, but it's only briefly mentioned and not much tested in the final.

## Study Resources

Iâ€™ve prepared some materials to help with the key concepts:

- `From_Data_Fitting_to_Integral_Transforms.pdf`: My second presentation. It explains **Laplace Transforms** and **Fourier Transforms** in detail.
- `Fundamentals_of_Signal_Processing_and_Data_Analysis_Homework_4.pdf`: A step-by-step explanation of the **Gibbs Phenomenon**.

These are useful if you want to understand the theory behind or before the course.

## Exam Tips

- The **final exam is almost entirely based on the homework**.
- If you study the homework carefully, you can get a good grade.
- If you know **Calculus II**, about **10 hours of review before the final** should be enough, trust me.

## Final Thoughts

This course is easy to pass, but if you want to fully understand signal and system, it takes much more time and effort.

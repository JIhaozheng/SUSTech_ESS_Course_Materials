# 📡 ESS206: Fundamentals of Signal Processing and Data Analysis 🎶📈

### 🎯 Main Focus: Signal Processing

Although the course title mentions both *signal processing* and *data analysis* 🧠📉, it mainly focuses on **signal processing** 🔊📐.  
In my opinion, **data analysis is more important** for us 🤷‍♂️💻 — but it’s only briefly mentioned and doesn’t appear much in the final exam 😤📄.

## 📚 Study Resources

I’ve prepared some handy materials to help with key concepts 📖🛠️:

- [`From_Data_Fitting_to_Integral_Transforms.pdf`](https://github.com/JIhaozheng/SUSTech_ESS_Course_Materials/blob/main/ESS206%20Fundamentals%20of%20Signal%20Processing%20and%20Data%20Analysis/presentation/From_Data_Fitting_to_Integral_Transforms.pdf)  
🧾 My $2nd$ presentation — explains **Laplace Transforms** ⚙️ and **Fourier Transforms** 🎵 in detail.  

- [`Fundamentals_of_Signal_Processing_and_Data_Analysis_Homework_4.pdf`](https://github.com/JIhaozheng/SUSTech_ESS_Course_Materials/blob/main/ESS206%20Fundamentals%20of%20Signal%20Processing%20and%20Data%20Analysis/homework/Fundamentals_of_Signal_Processing_and_Data_Analysis_Homework_4.pdf)  
  📌 $3rd$ Section offers a step-by-step guide to the **Gibbs Phenomenon** 🎢.

📎 These are super useful if you want to get ahead or review before class 💡🚀.

## 📝 Homework Notes

There are **8 homework assignments** in total 📋✍️.

- 🧩 **Homework #5** is about **signal fitting** using **Fourier series** 🎼.  
  It overlaps with the presentation above, so it's **not separately included** in this repo 🔄📂.

✅ Pro tip: Understand all the homework problems — that’s the **key to survival** in this course 🔑🧠.

## 🎓 Exam Tips

- The **final exam is almost entirely homework-based** 🔁📘.
- **~10 hours of review** before the final should be enough.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This course is **easy to pass** ✅😎  
But if you want to *really* understand signals and systems 🔍🧠, be ready to invest **a lot more time and effort** 💼📈.

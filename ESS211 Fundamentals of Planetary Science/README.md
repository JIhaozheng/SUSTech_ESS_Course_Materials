# 🪐 ESS210: Fundamentals of Planetary Science

---

## 📚 What’s This Course About?

If you want to dip your toes into **planetary science**, this course gives a wide overview. 🤲  
You’ll touch on many topics: planet formation, planetary interiors, atmospheres, orbital dynamics...  
No deep math, no hardcore physics — just big and fundamental concepts. 

Compared to **space science** 🌌, this course is actually *easier to follow*, because each chapter deals with a different type of physical system and research method.

## 🧠📚 Study Tips & Tricks

Prof. Lin has taught this course for many years and has a **mature teaching structure** — both in class and with homework.

It’s a **great starter course** for planetary science:
- Prof. Lin is serious about teaching and deeply values scientific thinking 🧪🧠  
- He’ll emphasize concepts over memorization or formulas  
- Sometimes the lectures can feel dry or hard to follow  

🧘‍♂️ My advice:  
Don’t stress trying to memorize. Instead, **grasp the big ideas**, and follow your interests.  
Use your heart, not just your eyes. ❤️👁️

## 📝 Homework Notes

There are only **6 homework assignments (2 after presentation)**, all open. 📝  
You can find most answers directly in the slides, but they require careful thinking and formal formatting.

Prof. Lin is kind in grading — small errors usually cost just 1 point. So stay relaxed, and aim high. 🌟

## ⚔️ Project & Exam Tips🚨

There’s **no midterm test**, but instead:  
A **mid-term presentation** based on a paper (usually from *Science* or *Nature*). 📄🎤

You’ll choose from a list provided by Prof. Lin.  
I picked:  
🪐 *“Seismic Detection of the Martian Core”* — because I plan to study seismology. This presentation opened up a **whole new perspective** for me on how seismic methods apply beyond Earth.

💬 My process:
- Spent **a LOT of time** reading and trying to understand  
- Wrote a detailed summary  

Honestly? It was exhausting, but **totally worth it**.  
If you're passionate about a topic, be ready to invest time and energy. 🔥⏳

The final includes:
- ✍️ **Short answer questions** covering basic concepts — no hot topics or curveballs,  — which means you should review everything on the slides, because anything could show up.
- 🧮 **Calculation questions**, so be sure to master:
  - **Hill sphere**
  - **Roche limit**
  - **Lagrangian points**
  - **Hydrostatic equilibrium** 
  - **Two-layer model** 
  - **Gravitational potential (J₂ term)**
  - **Thermal radiation**

This exam is a good opportunity to **review and preview** the whole course.

# 🌌 ESS210: Fundamentals of Space Science and Technology 🚀🛸

## 👨‍🏫 Course Overview

**Instructor:** Prof. Kaijun Liu 👨‍🔬  
**Email:** ✉️ youknow
**Office:** 🏢 College of Science, Room **he will tell you**

### 📚 What’s this course about?

Honestly? I don’t really know. 🤷‍♂️😂  
The midterm and final are **open book/tests** 📖💻 — and yes, **ChatGPT is allowed** 🙌🧠  
(Actually, I wrote this README with GPT’s help. Big brain energy 🧠⚡)

So... yeah, I may have done a little *touching fish* 🐟🫣 during lectures.

That said, Prof. Liu often shares some cool stories about **microsatellites** 🛰️ and his own research experience 🌌🔬.  
You can talk to him *anytime* — whether it’s questions about the course or just random science talk. 🗣️☕  
He’s a **thoughtful**, **serious**, and **super approachable** professor 🧑‍🏫💬. Always happy to chat if you show genuine curiosity!

## 🧠📚 Study Tips & Tricks

Wanna *actually* learn something? 👉 Then **follow the lecture closely** 👂👀  
But heads-up: Prof. Liu explains space phenomena using only basic physics 🧪🧲.  
❌ No continuum mechanics  
❌ No plasma physics  
✅ Just the fundamentals  

It’s a bit too *simple & shallow* for my taste 🥱  
Also... this course throws **a LOT** of info at you 📡🌠💥  
I can’t remember everything 🧠💔 (and honestly, I won’t try — it's open test, Internet will help 📲🌐).  
Most of the time I’m like: "Yeah I’ve heard of it... but don’t ask me what it is." 🤯❓

## ⚔️ Exam Tips & Warnings 🚨

### 🔥 Midterm  
Open test = no worries, right? 😌📘  
Well... the TA is from **department of physics** 🧠🔬 — and graded like a **dark souls boss** 💀🛡️  
- Median: 78  
- Average: 77.875  

Still survivable tho 😤💪

### 🧨 Final Exam  
**A total boss battle.** 😵‍💫💥  
All open-ended questions 📝 — for the first 5, I was thinking clearly 🧠💡  
Then suddenly? **PANIC MODE** 😱⏰  
No time to think, just *type and pray* 🤖✍️🙏

ChatGPT could’ve saved me… but guess what? **My Plus expired the day before** 😭💔  
I *knew* GPT’s answer was wrong ❌🤖, but I couldn’t find the slides 📂📉  
So I just wrote *something*… anything… and hoped for mercy 🫠🛐

By the end, I was finishing questions in like 10 minutes each ⌛💨  
Eventually, I found a life-saving hack:  
> “Hi GPT! Please summarize the key points in under 200 words.”  
💡 This trick helped me fill in the blanks just in time 🧾⚡

**Dear Prof. Liu: Please don’t fail me. 🙇‍♂️🍵

## 💭 Final Thoughts

Take it easy ✌️😌  
Don’t stress too much 😅 — just surf the wave 🌊 of knowledge  
Use GPT wisely 🤖🔍  
And remember: **don’t let the space-tech gods humble you too hard** 👽🛸💫

Good luck, spacemen 🚀🌍  
Let’s hope we pass... 🤞🎓💀

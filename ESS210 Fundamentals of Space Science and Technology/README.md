# 🌌 ESS210: Fundamentals of Space Science and Technology 🚀

## 👨‍🏫 Course Overview

**Instructor:** Prof. Kaijun Liu  
**Email:** liukj@sustech.edu.cn  
**Office:** College of Science, Room E5142  

### 📚 What’s this course about?

Honestly? I'm still figuring it out. 😂  
Midterm and final are **open book/tests**, and yes — **ChatGPT is allowed** (bless). So... yeah, I may have done a little *touching fish* 🐟 during lectures.

## 📖 Study Resources

Want to *actually* learn something? Then pay attention in class — seriously.  
But be warned: Prof. Liu explains everything with the most basic physics 🧪. No continuum mechanics, no plasma physics... just fundamental stuff. So, yeah, it feels a bit too simple and shallow sometimes.

Also... this course throws **a LOT** of knowledge at you. I can’t remember it all (and tbh, I don’t plan to 🫠). I just kinda recognize the topics and hope for the best.

## 📑 Homework Notes

Only **3 homework assignments**. That’s it. 😮‍💨

| Homework | Median | Average |
|----------|--------|---------|
| HW1      | 12.5   | 13.125  |
| HW2      | 17.5   | 14.5625 |
| HW3      | 12.5   | 11.875  |

Too little? Maybe. But also... thank you, Prof 🙏

## 📝 Exam Tips & Warnings

### Midterm 💥  
Open test = no stress, right? Well… sort of.  
TA was from the **physics department** and graded like a **boss-level gatekeeper** 👨‍🔬.  
- Median: 78  
- Average: 77.875  
Still survivable tho!

### Final Exam 😭  
**Pure pain.**  
All open-ended questions. First 5 were fine... and then? Panic mode.  
No time to think. Just *type and pray*.  
ChatGPT would've helped, but guess what? **My Plus expired the day before.** 😭

So I knew the GPT answer was wrong... but I couldn't find the right slides. So I filled in the blanks with hope and desperation. ✍️😔  
Dear Prof. Liu: *Please be gentle with grading.*

Take it easy, don’t stress too much.  
Learn what you can, use GPT wisely, and **don’t let the space-tech gods humble you too hard**. 👽✨  
Let’s just hope we pass. 💀🎓

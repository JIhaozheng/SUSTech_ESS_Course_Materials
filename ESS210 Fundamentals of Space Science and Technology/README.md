# 🌌 ESS210: Fundamentals of Space Science and Technology 🚀🛸

## 👨‍🏫 Course Overview

**Instructor:** Prof. Kaijun Liu 👨‍🔬  
**Email:** 📧 liukj@sustech.edu.cn  
**Office:** 🏢 College of Science, Room E5142  

### 📚 What’s this course about?

Honestly? I don't know. 🤷‍♂️😂  
Midterm and final are **open book/tests** 📖💻 — and yes, **ChatGPT is allowed** 🙌🧠  
Actually, I wrote this README with GPT’s help. Big brain energy 🧠⚡
So... yeah, I may have done a little *touching fish* 🐟🫣 during lectures.

## 🧠📖 Study Resources

Wanna *actually* learn something? 👉 Then **follow the lecture closely** 👂👀  
But heads-up: Prof. Liu explains space phenomena using only basic physics 🧪🧲.  
❌ No continuum mechanics  
❌ No plasma physics  
✅ Just the fundamentals  

It’s a bit too *simple & shallow* for my taste 🥱  
Also... this course throws **a LOT** of info at you 📡🌠💥  
I can’t remember everything 🧠💔 (and honestly, I won’t try — it's open test, Internet will help 📲🌐).  
Most of the time I’m like: "Yeah I’ve heard of it... but don’t ask me what it is." 🤯❓

## 📝📊 Homework Notes

Only **3 homework assignments** 📃✍️ — that’s it. 😮‍💨🫶

| 📌 Homework | 📈 Median | 📉 Average |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| HW1        | 12.5      | 13.125     |
| HW2        | 17.5      | 14.5625    |
| HW3        | 12.5      | 11.875     |

Too little? Maybe 😅  
But also... **thank you, Prof.** 🙏🌟💐

## ⚔️ Exam Tips & Warnings 🚨

### 🔥 Midterm  
Open test = no worries, right? 😌📘  
Well... the TA is from **department of physics** 🧠🔬 — and graded like a **dark souls boss** 💀🛡️  
- Median: 78  
- Average: 77.875  

Still survivable tho 😤💪

### 🧨 Final Exam  
**A total boss battle.** 😵‍💫  
All open-ended questions 📝 — first 5? I was thinking 🧠💡  
Then suddenly? **PANIC MODE** 😱⏰  
No time to think, just *type and pray* 🤖✍️🙏

ChatGPT could’ve saved me, but guess what? **My Plus expired the day before** 😭💔  
I knew GPT's answer was wrong ❌🤖 but I couldn’t find the slides 📂📉  
So I wrote *something*... anything... and hoped for mercy 🫠🛐

**Dear Prof. Liu: please don’t fail me 🙇‍♂️🍵**

## 💭 Final Thoughts

Take it easy ✌️😌  
Don’t stress too much 😅 — just surf the wave 🌊 of knowledge  
Use GPT wisely 🤖🔍  
And remember: **don’t let the space-tech gods humble you too hard** 👽🛸💫

Good luck, spacemen 🚀🌍  
Let’s hope we pass... 🤞🎓💀
